#1. Given a hash of family members, with keys as the title and an array of names as the values, use Ruby's built-in select method to gather only immediate family members' names into a new array.
#2. Look at Ruby's merge method. Notice that it has two versions. What is the difference between merge and merge!? Write a program that uses both and illustrate the differences.
#3 Using some of Ruby's built-in Hash methods, write a program that loops through a hash and prints all of the keys. Then write a program that does the same thing except printing the values. Finally, write a program that prints both.
