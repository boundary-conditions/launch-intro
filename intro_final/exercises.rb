#Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr.each { |i| puts i }

#Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.

six_up_arr = []
arr.each do |i|
  if i > 5
    six_up_arr.push(i)
  end
end

puts six_up_arr

#Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.

odd_arr = []
six_up_arr.select do |num|
  if num.odd?
  odd_arr.push(num)

#Append 11 to the end of the original array. Prepend 0 to the beginning
arr.push(11)

#Get rid of 11. And append a 3

#Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value

#What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
#An array keeps items organized by index number, in order, a hash organizes things using descriptive pairs.

#Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.
literal_hash = {:l_key => "value"}
hash = Hash.new
hash[:key] = "value"
new_hash = {n_key: "value"}

#Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
#1. Get the value of key `:b`.
h[:b]
#2 Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h[:e] = 5
#3 Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.each do |k,v|
  if v < 3.5
    h.delete(k)
  end
end

#Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)
arrays_as_values = {:hash1 => [1,2,3,4,5]}
#yes arrays can be used as a value in a hash key:value pair
hash_arr = [{a: 2, b: 3},{c: 4, d: 5}] #Yes hashes can be stored in an array
hash_arr[0][:b] #to access the hash you use array index number followed by the key.

#Given the following data structures. Write a program that copies the information 
#from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.
contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

contact_data.each do |a|
  a.each do |b|
    if b.include?("joe")
      contacts["Joe Smith"] = {:email => a[0],:address => a[1],:phone => a[2]}
    else
      contacts["Sally Johnson"] = {:email => a[0],:address => a[1],:phone => a[2]}
    end
  end 
end

#Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number?
puts "Joe Smith's email is #{contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]}"
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone]

#Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.
arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
# s = arr.length-1
# while s > 0
#  arr.delete_if(arr[s].start_with?("s")) ### My crazy attempt before consulting the ruby docs.
#  s -= 1
# end

arr.delete_if { |s| s.start_with?("s") }
#Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the words that start with "s" or starts with "w".
arr.delete_if { |s| s.start_with?("s","w") }

#Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

#and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
#(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
#Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
new_array = a.map { |s| s.split(" ") }
new_array.flatten!

#What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

#Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

#Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry in the contacts hash, like this:

contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

arr_pop = [:email, :address, :phone]

arr_pop.each do |a|
  contacts["Joe Smith"][a] = contact_data.shift
end



# My first try at the previous problem
#contacts.each do |k,v|
#    v[arr_pop][0] = contact_data[0]
#    arr_pop.shift
#    contact_data.shift
#end

#As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}
fields = [:email, :address, :phone]

contacts.each_with_index do |(name, hash), idx| #Enumerator, idx iterates from 0++ with each 'each' instance
  fields.each do |field|
    hash[field] = contact_data[idx].shift #here contact_data[idx] starts at 0 for the first each instance on contacts, and moves to [1] for the second.
  end
